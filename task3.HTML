Every life matters, and it might not seem like it but you are destined for something great! I </p>
        <P>second paragraph.have had a rough life and have thought multiple times that it would never get better. As I get older, I realize that the struggle I go through makes me who I am. I am a stronger person because of what I went through and still go through. I will only get stronger from the struggles and curveballs, and even though sometimes I feel like giving up I remember I am worth it! So, here is a short story about what I’ve gone through as a child and what I go through now as an adult.</P>
